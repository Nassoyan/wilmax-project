        There is no better source of inspiration than the nature around us. A
        variety of textures, charming colours, natural forms â€“ natural resources
        amaze with their beauty. The love of nature inspired the designers of
        Wilmax to create the most picturesque collection. It consists of white,
        sand and black dishes, which have the texture of natural stone. The
        style of this collection symbolizes the infinity of the universe,
        calmness and inviolability.
